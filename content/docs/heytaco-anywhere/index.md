Heytaco Anywhere is the 3rd party App of [HeyTaco!](https://www.heytaco.chat/how) to give ðŸŒ® in other services.

### What is Heytaco Anywhere?

[HeyTaco!](https://www.heytaco.chat/) is a great tool; it sparks conversations and builds stronger relationships by giving ðŸŒ® in Slack and Microsoft teams. But all of the conversations don't occur only in Slack and Teams. In many cases, it happens in other services; for engineers, Github (or Gitlab) is usually one of the places to discuss; for business managers, Jira is one of the places to debate. 

Heytaco Anywhere expands HeyTaco! to other services, not only Slack and Teams. By being enabled to send ðŸŒ® in Github, Jira, and other services, eventually, it spread fun and celebrated to all the places. 

### How does it works? 

For example, if you want to send ðŸŒ®  in the pull request of Github, leave the comment with ðŸŒ® . It's just all!
